# lightrain_spider

## Introduction
A web crawler or also know as spider and bot is an internet bot. This bot is used to index the content from a paticular website or many websites. This bot is used in different ways for different purposes. It is used by search engines like google(googlebot) to rank the pages and display them in order by going through many websites. Or a crawler can be used to crawl through only one website and gather information from that page alone.

## Idea behind lightrain_spider
Every webpage has a html format. So we accessed that html format to gather the info in a ethical way. But every webpage has its own html format and very unique from anyother webpage. So our web spider concentrates on single webpage-amazon.

## How does lightrain_spider work?
We used beautifulsoap to extract the content from the webpage. And requests module to access webpage using python language. And using beautifulsoap features we have processed the required elements and simply displayed it. We have also used pyshorteners to shortern the embedded links, which otherwise are very long and give a disturbing display to the user.
